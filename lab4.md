3. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?<br />

To make rule about permission of who can use or modify your code. Tell community what they can do and can't do about your code. So everyone can use and share under the rule the software legally.


4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?<br />

If there isn't an explicit license, then it's not technically open source or free. Because you don't have permission to mofity or redistribute the code without the agreement from copyright holder. Therefore, there's legel risk by using the no license code.



5.Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
Do you agree with this claim? Write two to five sentences in your lab report.<br />

I agree with the claim. The open source software should be free and more accessable to everyone without unnecessary protocol. The Gopher protocol became a declined predecessor in the open world wide web. To reach the ideas of four criteria for Free Software, making it free and simple is much more ideal.


6. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.

Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
Write your justification in your lab report.<br />

Android is an operating system for mobile phones and other devices that consists of Linux, some libraries, a Java platform and some applications. The software of Android versions 1 and 2 was mostly developed by Google. Android is very different from the GNU/Linux operating system because it contains very little of GNU. The only component in common is Linux, the kernel. Google has not converted Linux to the Apache license, and will not try to do so. The Apache license on the rest of Android does not require source release, making Android 3, apart from Linux, nonfree software pure and simple. Google withheld the 3.0 source code for Android because it was buggy, but it later released it for version 4 (also with source code). Products using those versions of Android don't respect users' freedom because they contain nonfree Google applications. Most Android devices come with the nonfree Google Play software, which has a back door with which Google can forcibly install or deinstall apps. If you value freedom, don't use Google Play; instead, get free Android apps from f-droid.org. One user discovered that the Android system that came with his phone was modified to send personal data to Motorola. Replicant is a free version of Android that replaces many nonfree libraries.

Many Android devices are tyrants, so users cannot install their own modified software. However, some Android devices can be "rooted" so users can install different software.

The phone network firmware comes preinstalled and can be remotely controlled to overwrite the rest of the software in the device. Malicious features are unacceptable no matter how they are implemented, and the phone network firmware is a malicious circuit.

The phone network firmware in an Android phone is not equivalent to a circuit, because the hardware allows installation of new versions. We can tolerate nonfree phone network firmware provided new versions won't be loaded, and the firmware can't take control of the main computer.

Recent press coverage of Android focuses on the patent wars. However, the topic of this article is how Android products partly approach an ethically system of distribution, and how they fall short.
