To make rule about permission of who can use or modify your code. Tell community what they can do and can't do about your code. So everyone can use and share under the rule the software legally.

If there isn't an explicit license, then it's not technically open source or free. Because you don't have permission to mofity or redistribute the code without the agreement from copyright holder. Therefore, there's legel risk by using the no license code.

I agree with the claim. The open source software should be free and more accessable to everyone without unnecessary protocol. The Gopher protocol became a declined predecessor in the open world wide web. To reach the ideas of four criteria for Free Software, making it free and simple is much more ideal.

The software of Android versions 1 and 2 was mostly developed by Google. Android is very different from the GNU/Linux operating system because it contains very little of GNU. The only component in common is Linux, the kernel. Google has not converted Linux to the Apache license, and will not try to do so. The Apache license on the rest of Android does not require source release, making Android 3, apart from Linux, nonfree software pure and simple. Google withheld the 3.0 source code for Android because it was buggy, but it later released it for version 4 with source code. Products using those versions of Android don't respect users' freedom because they contain nonfree Google applications. Most Android devices come with the nonfree Google Play software, which has a back door with which Google can forcibly install or deinstall apps. Many Android devices are tyrants, so users cannot install their own modified software. However, some Android devices can be "rooted" so users can install different software. The phone network firmware comes preinstalled and can be remotely controlled to overwrite the rest of the software in the device. Malicious features are unacceptable no matter how they are implemented, and the phone network firmware is a malicious circuit.
